# Package Management Rule

- Always activate the virtual environment before doing any package management (`source .venv/bin/activate` from the root dir).
- Always use `uv` for installing, updating, and removing Python dependencies.
- Do NOT use `pip`, `pipenv`, or `poetry` for package management in this project.
- When adding dependencies, run `uv pip install <package>` and update `pyproject.toml` as needed.
- When removing dependencies, use `uv pip uninstall <package>`.
- Ensure all contributors follow this rule for consistency and reproducibility.
