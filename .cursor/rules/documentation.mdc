When writing documentation files:

- be clear, but concise
- use diagrams to illustrate where it adds clarity
    - use mermaid diagrams
- if a documentation file is over 200 lines long, break it into multiple smaller files
- use README.md files throughout the repo to give context at a feature level, or for subdirs of the repo
- if a comment is marked as important, do not remove it without asking first
