- When creating command-line interfaces with Typer, use positional arguments (`typer.Argument`) for all required fields. Use named options (`typer.Option`) for all non-required (optional) fields.

# CLI Rules

- Follow the Architecture Standards rules for layering and boundaries (see `architecture.mdc`).
- Use Typer for argument parsing and Rich for output.
- Validate inputs early and exit with helpful errors (use `typer.Exit(1)` on failure).
- Prefer async operations by delegating to async functions in `src/ia_lib/operations`.
