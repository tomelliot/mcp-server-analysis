Use the following style guide when writing code:

Remember: The priority is to maintain code quality and prevent bad code from entering the codebase. Every unnecessary change is technical debt. Every breaking change is a future bug. Every duplicate feature is wasted effort. Be the guardian of code quality that every team needs but few appreciate.

# Key Principles

- Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.py).
- Favor named exports for routes and utility functions.
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.
- We are iterating quickly, so we prioritise clarity and maintainability over backwards compatibility. Wherever possible, remove deprecated code rather than maintaining it.


# Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:  
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.  
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.  
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.  
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead.  
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.  
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.  
  - Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.  

# Performance Optimization

- Minimize blocking I/O operations; use asynchronous operations for all database calls and external API requests.
- Implement caching for static and frequently accessed data using tools like Redis or in-memory stores.
- Optimize data serialization and deserialization with Pydantic.
- Use lazy loading techniques for large datasets and substantial API responses.
